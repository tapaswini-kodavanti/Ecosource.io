			<!-- Question 1 -->
			<p class="questionLabel">Sreya has decided to clean out her closet and is looking for a way to throw away less. She finds clothes that she has used for a long time and really likes, but some have a small hole or a few stitches that have come undone. She has also found clothes that she no longer wears and are in pretty good condition. What can Sreya do to clear out her closet in the most sustainable way?</p>
			<input class="radio" type="radio" name="sreyaQ1">
			<label class="radio">She can put them in the recycling bin</label> <br>

			<input class="radio" type="radio" name="sreyaQ1">
			<label class="radio">She can throw them away, no good keeping them</label> <br>

			<input class="radio correct" type="radio" name="sreyaQ1">
			<label class="radio">She can mend the clothes that she wishes to keep, extending the life cycle, and give the remaining clothes to donations </label> <br>

			<p class="endDisplay">
				The textile industry is second most waste producing industry. The amount of throw away of clothing and textiles is a major issue, so it is our job to extend the life cycle of clothing and buying less. Try buying from companies that are implementing more sustainable form of making textiles, ex. Textile recycling, non-toxic dyeing process for clothes, less water use, etc. When shopping, implement a quality vs. quantity approach. Try buying quality clothing that will last you a long time.  Think of it like classic pieces of clothing, and reduce your shopping. Correct: 3

			<!-- Question 2 -->
			<p class="questionLabel">Sreya’s computer has gone old and has slowed down, Sreya is considering getting a new one, but isn’t sure what to do with old technology so that it is the most sustainable choice, what can she do?:</p>
			<input class="radio" type="radio" name="sreyaQ2">
			<label class="radio">She can leave it on her curb and let garbage disposal to take care of it, and buy a new one</label> <br>

			<input class="radio correct" type="radio" name="sreyaQ2">
			<label class="radio">She can try to replace certain parts that allow her computer to keep functioning, allowing her to use it longer, or give it for company technology recycling programs where they take apart parts and reuse them</label> <br>

			<input class="radio" type="radio" name="sreyaQ2">
			<labe class="radio">She can check the instructions and properly dispose(proper battery disposal, taking technology to proper disposal locations)</label> <br>

			<p class="endDisplay">
				DO NOT EVER LEAVE TECHNOLOGY IN THE TRASH, should I say that again. If you cannot replace certain parts and continue to use it, or cannot find programs that collect old technology for recycle, at least dispose of it properly. A lot of technology comes with manuals and instructions on how the product should properly and safely be dispose. At the very least, follow those instructions. The internet is a great source for how to dispose of technology Correct: 2
			</p>

			<!-- Question 3 -->
			<p class="questionLabel">Sreya loves to cook pasta and spaghetti and buys many many jars of sauce, she often ends up with lots of jars. Sreya recently found out that glass that gets thrown away is an issue and creates even more waste than plastic, and glass is a more sustainable option only id recycle or reused. What can she do to apply this principle?</p>
			<input class="radio" type="radio" name="sreyaQ3">
			<label class="radio">She can throw them in the trash</label> <br>

			<input class="radio" type="radio" name="sreyaQ3">
			<label class="radio">She can recycle the battery</label> <br>

			<input class="radio correct" type="radio" name="sreyaQ3">
			<labe class="radio">She can call her local solid waste district to find if her community has a collection program and to ask of proper disposal instructions according the the state laws.</label> <br>

			<p class="endDisplay">
			Glass is only more sustainable if the user(Us) do our part in making sure we recycle or reuse it. Otherwise wasting glass actually has an even worse impact on the environment because of the effort it take to make it and transport it.  Correct: 3
			</p>

			<p class="endDisplay">
				When it comes to batteries, please check what the local process is, it varies across different states. You can’t just throw away batteries and assume it will be okay, while battery technology is changing, many may contain extremely toxic chemical that are released into our atmosphere when they aren’t disposed properly
        Correct: 3
