<p> What is littering? Littering is any type of trash thrown in small amounts, especially where it does not belong. You may think that these items will be picked up but they are destroying the environment. Even the little pieces of straws that are thrown, each time someone does that the litter piles up. This reduces air quality, The litter then ends up in our water system, animals digestive tracts, and smothering our plants.</p>

<p> The leading type of litter on beaches is plastic, with about 60-80% of litter being some form of plastic. This is extremely dangerous, because it can affect entire ecosystems down to miniscule plankton. Over 260 different animal spieces have been tangled or caught in some kind of fishing line, ropes, or nets.</p>

<p>Plastic pollution has a deadly and direct affect on animals. Fish in the North Pacific ingest 12,000 to 24,000 tons of plastic a year. This can cause intestinal injury or death. With the little fish eating all of this plastic, this travels to big fish and humans, since we eat the little fish. The effects on the human body are diabetes, stroke, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and rheumatoid arthritis. </p>

<p><span class="third"> Over 180 Million tons of toxic waste are dumped each year. </span>Toxic waste is a destructive substance that can affect humans and animals whether it ends up on the ground or in the air.
The toxins from this toxic waste can harm many bodily functions. For instance, the body’s capacity to prevent free radical damage decreases, which accelerates aging.

  <h1>Strategies to reduce waste</h1>
  <h3>It can be challenging to always throw trash in the trash can, remember what needs to be recycled, and what is reusable and not. Start by trying to cycle twice a month, then move to recycling for two weeks, then do twice a week. Try to keep a trash bag in your car so you are not tempted to throw food outside. All you need to remeber is the 5 R's.</h3>
